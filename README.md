## Exercise 2: Create a front-end web app that displays a collection of things (React.js).

**Option 1: Build a “bookshelf” app** 
* Our team decides not to do this exercise; I did individually for extra credit.
###### All teams:
* Your goal is to create a front-end web app that displays a collection of things. This can be your favourite books, TV shows, animals, travel destinations, etc. => * I decided to display travel destination *
* The user should be able to see your entire collection on the homepage (i.e. the “preview” of each item). => * item component *
* The user should be able to click on an item in your collection to see additional info about it. For example, a book item might show author, genre, publication date, etc. * ItemDetail Component, and it lands another page by React Router *
* Create your component architecture however you see fit. React requires components while Vue does not, but using components in Vue can be helpful.
    * While you’re free to divide your app into as many components as you’d like, we recommend that you think about writing the following 3 components:
    ```
        <Collection /> - displays the complete collection on the home page
        <Item /> - displays the preview of one item. There are many items within your collection.
        <ItemDetail /> - the additional info shown when user clicks on an item.
    ```
* You can hard-code your data store (name, image, details, etc.) in JSON format. Pass the data for each item in your collection as props into your components in React or Vue, or dynamically render the data using Vue binding directives if you choose not to use components.
* You may use any external packages you think are helpful. However, we should be able to install all dependencies and run your app properly by following the instructions in your repo’s README (hint: write an easy-to-follow README!)


###### Teams > 2, choose at least 1 of the following features to implement. Two features that I decided to implement are:
* Learn about create-react-app and use it for this exercise. Separate each component into its own file and import them as needed (enabled by Webpack). OR learn about Vue CLI and use it for this exercise. Create a Vue Webpack project and write code in .vue files instead (it’s much prettier this way!).
    * I start to initialize react app by npm create-react-app my-app. Then, npm init react-app. Whenever I run the app, I do npm start.
* When the user clicks on an item, instead of displaying the details on the same page, direct the user to a new page with the item details. 
React Hint: react-router-dom will make your life easier.
Vue Hint: vue-router is helpful, and this article explains how to use it better than the docs
